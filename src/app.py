#This file is our Website's server.
# It uses Flask to create a web application that recommends movies based on user input.
# It imports necessary libraries and modules, loads a dataset of movies, and sets up a Flask app.
# It defines a route for the home page and another for the recommendation feature.
# The recommendation feature uses a function from another module to get movie recommendations based on the title provided by the user.
